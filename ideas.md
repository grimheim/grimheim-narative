# Ideas

This is a dumping place for ideas. When they are fleshed out enough I will move
them into separate topics.

## Factions

Factions are tied heavily to the realms from which they intially came from

* Light (needs renaming)
* Dark (needs renaming)
* Demonic (needs renaming)
* Angelic (needs renaming)
* Arcane - Humans
* Nature - Fey folk

## History

Initially all realms were connected. Humans severed the connection as it was
poisoning them, this has been lost to time and now it is assumed the humans
did this out of greed. Because of this the other races hunt the humans, who
over this time they have become criminals

## Magic

Using magic draws power from that realm, which weakens the separation between
the realms temporarily, which can allow things to pass between the realms.

Using magic not native to your species can be dangerous, excessive use may
injure a character.
